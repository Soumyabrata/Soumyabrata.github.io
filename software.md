# Software
We also worked on a few software-based projects, such as heap-management techniques and cryptography.

## Team
This work was performed at [National Institute of Technology Silchar](http://www.nits.ac.in/), India, and <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/in">Ericsson India</a>.

## Description 

### Heap management
Heap management is responsible for the allocation of heap segments to a running application. When the logic of the heap management is left to the application programmer, as it is the case with programming languages like C and C++, a number of problems may arise. One kind of problems related to imperfect heap management is that of memory fragmentation. Hence compaction of data is required to increase the efficient data storage capacity of the memory. Depending on whether active blocks within the heap may be shifted in position, one of the two approaches to compaction is possible: partial compaction and full compaction. But both these methods are too expensive and hence they are generally not used in large program modules. In this project, a new heap management technique MFAC (Minimum Fragmentation and Auto Compaction) is proposed which has an inherent auto-compaction technique in its algorithm leading to minimum fragmentation of memory space. Simulation results show that in most scenarios, MFAC outperforms the 1st fit and best fit technique by a considerable margin. 


### Cryptography
Fascinating commerce activities, transactions and services are possible if secured communications can be easily employed in open networks. An effective solution to securing communications over open networks is to apply cryptography. Encryptions, digital signatures, password-based user authentication, are some of the most basic cryptographic techniques for securing communications. But, however, for many *fancier* applications, the basic cryptographic techniques are no longer adequate. Hence, the need of the hour is an efficient but simple, encryption and decryption algorithm for encrypting any kind of data. Also, the keys required for encryption and decryption must be randomized and randomly generated from the changing data bits. Our newly proposed algorithm humbly tries to satisfy the above two criteria to some extent.

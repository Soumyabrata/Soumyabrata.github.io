# Wireless Communication

## Objective 
Understanding user communication in wireless networks.

## Team
This work was performed at [Indian Institute of Science Bangalore](http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/~vinod/), India. 

## Description 

In this project, a novel idea of user cooperation in wireless networks has been exploited to improve the performance of the IEEE 802.11 protocol. A crucial challenge in the implementation of a cooperative diversity protocol is how to assign source-relay pairs. We propose a new high-performance forwarding scheme, denoted Timer based Adaptive Relay Selection Protocol (TARSeP) that efficiently improves the overall throughput in wireless 802.11 networks. 

<br/>
Several schemes have come up which deal with these issues but it involves timing accuracy and synchronization. Others have dealt with such issues but with predefined assumptions (e.g. network topology is known beforehand). A routing protocol should be such that neither should it rely on network topology nor timing synchronization is necessary. Also, the channel gain between the destination and a particular relay does not always remain constant. The relay must be selected sensing the current channel condition between the relay and the destination. Our protocol humbly tries to include such issues in relay selection protocol and show enhancement in system performance.

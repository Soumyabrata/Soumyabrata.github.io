I am an <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/soumyabrata.dev/">Assistant Professor</a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.ucd.ie/">School of Computer Science</a>, at <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/">University College Dublin</a>. I am also affiliated with <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/earth/">UCD Earth Institute</a>, and an Academic Collaborator with <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie">ADAPT SFI Research Centre</a>, Dublin. 

<br />
I graduated with a B.Tech from <a href="http://www.nits.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Silchar</a>, India summa cum laude in 2010. Post graduation, I worked with <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/in">Ericsson India</a> as a network engineer from 2010 to 2012. Then I went on to complete my Ph.D. from <a href="www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx">Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=EYHLEE">Prof. Lee Yee Hui</a> and <a href="https://stefan.winkler.site/">Dr. Stefan Winkler</a>, in 2017. From Aug-Dec 2015, I was a visiting <a href="http://people.epfl.ch/soumyabrata.dev">Doctoral Assistant</a> at <a href="http://lcav.epfl.ch/">Audiovisual Communication Laboratory (LCAV)</a>, at <a href="http://www.epfl.ch/">Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne</a>, Switzerland, under the supervision of <a href="http://lcav.epfl.ch/martin.vetterli">Prof. Martin Vetterli</a> and <a href="https://lcav.epfl.ch/people/people-current_staff/people-adam-scholefield/">Dr. Adam Scholefield</a>. During my Ph.D., I was a team member of <a href="http://vintage.winklerbros.net/index.html">Vision & InterAction Group (Vintage)</a>, at <a href="http://adsc.illinois.edu/">Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC)</a>, the Singapore-based research center of the <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. From 2017 till 2019, I was a <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/team-members/person-detail/soumyabrata-dev">Postdoctoral Researcher</a> at <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie">ADAPT Centre</a>, the [Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)](http://www.sfi.ie/)-funded research centre, based at <a href="http://www.tcd.ie">Trinity College Dublin</a>. I worked on industry-affiliated projects with <a href="https://francois.pitie.net">Prof. Fran&ccedil;ois Piti&eacute;</a> and <a href="https://ie.linkedin.com/in/declanmckibben">Declan McKibben</a>, <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/industry/design-and-innovation-lab">Design & Innovation Lab (dLab)</a>, ADAPT Centre. I was also an <a href="https://www.ncirl.ie/Faculty-Depts/A-Z-Staff-Directory/Staff/404">Associate Faculty</a> at <a href="https://www.ncirl.ie/Faculty-Depts/School-of-Computing">School of Computing</a>, <a href="https://www.ncirl.ie">National College of Ireland</a>, Dublin during 2018-2019.

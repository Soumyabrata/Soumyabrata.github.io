I am an <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/soumyabrata.dev/">Assistant Professor</a> in the <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/cs/">School of Computer Science</a>, at <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/">University College Dublin (UCD)</a>. I am also an Institute Member of <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/earth/">UCD Earth Institute</a>, and an SFI Funded Investigator with <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie">ADAPT SFI Research Centre</a>, Dublin. 

<br />
I lead the <a href="https://soumyabrata.dev/theia/">THE visIon and Analytics lab (THEIA)</a> at UCD. Our research interests primarily lie in the area of computer vision, image processing, and remote sensing. Leveraging techniques from statistical machine learning and deep learning, we tackle interdisciplinary computational problems in diverse fields, including digital multimedia, atmospheric research, coastal monitoring, and solar and renewable energy.

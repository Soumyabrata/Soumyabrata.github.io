<br />
I lead the <a href="https://soumyabrata.dev/theia/">THE visIon and Analytics lab (THEIA)</a> at UCD. Our research interests primarily lie in the area of computer vision, image processing, and remote sensing. Leveraging techniques from statistical machine learning and deep learning, we tackle interdisciplinary computational problems in diverse fields, including digital multimedia, atmospheric research, coastal monitoring, and solar and renewable energy.

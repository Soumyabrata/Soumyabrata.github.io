## THEIA: THE visIon and Analytics lab

Welcome to the <a href="https://soumyabrata.github.io/theia/">THEIA: THE visIon and Analytics lab</a>. The THEIA lab is based in the <a href="https://www.cs.ucd.ie/">School of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/">University College Dublin</a>. Our group's <a href="https://soumyabrata.github.io/research/">research</a> is funded by <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/">University College Dublin</a> and the <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie">ADAPT SFI Research Centre</a>. 

<br />
Our research interests are in the area of computer vision, image processing, and remote sensing. We use techniques from statistical machine learning and deep learning, to solve interdisciplinary computational problems in various fields of digital multimedia, atmospheric research, and solar and renewable energy. 

<br />
We always look for hard-working PhD students and self-motivated postdoctoral researchers to join us, <a href="mailto:soumyabrata.dev@adaptcentre.ie">contact us</a> for more details.

##### Why THEIA
All great research starts with a story. Our group's name THEIA lab is derived from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia">Greek goddess Theia</a>, also referred as the Titan goddess of sight (thea), and the bright blue sky (aithre). Also, Theia's brother is Hyperion, who is a god of the sun. Quite interestingly, our group's research is focused on computer vision, solar and renewable energy etc. Credits to <a href="https://twitter.com/hossari">Murhaf</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BadmotorF">Fabrizio</a> for this wonderful idea.

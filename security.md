# Security

## Objective 
To provide useful insights to security aspects in Software Defined Networks (SDNs). 

## Team
This is a collaborative work between:
- [ADAPT SFI Research Centre](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/)
- [University College Dublin](https://www.cs.ucd.ie/)

## Description 
In most cases of atmospheric study, collocated weather stations are present alongside ground-based sky cameras. Unlike solar pyranometers and other regular meteorological sensors, ground-based sky images have additional information about the continuous evolution of cloud over time. In this research theme, we attempt to use a multi-modal approach of using data from various sensors to better understand solar energy estimation and forecasting. 

<br />
We use techniques derived from time-series theory, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05872">model the seasonality</a> of solar irradiance, as captured in solar sensors. In addition to using weather data, we also derive solar analytics information from images, captured via ground-based sky cameras. We use these cloud/sky images to propose a solar radiation estimation model, that can accurately <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02546">capture the short-term fluctuations</a> of solar irradiance. We also use these sequence of images to estimate cloud motion fields, and thereby <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06666v1.pdf">predict future locations of cloud</a> with a lead time of a few minutes. These solar estimation and cloud forecasting techniques are useful in the field of solar energy generation and forecasting.

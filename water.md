# Water

## Objective 
To develop scalable methods for accurate water body detection using spectral analysis and deep learning.

## Team
This is a collaborative work between:
- [ADAPT SFI Research Centre](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/)
- [University College Dublin](https://www.cs.ucd.ie/)

## Description 

Water is a cornerstone of ecosystems and human society, yet monitoring its distribution and dynamics remains challenging. Our research develops computational methods to detect, classify, and monitor water bodies using remote sensing data. By combining hyperspectral and multispectral satellite imagery with advanced machine learning, we deliver accurate and scalable water monitoring solutions.

<br />
We investigate the use of spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Water Index (WI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) for extracting rivers, lakes, coastal waters, and even narrow streams. Our studies show that traditional indices often misclassify water pixels, whereas the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) excels in delineating coastlines and small streams. This enables precise mapping for environmental monitoring and hydrological applications.

<br />
Alongside spectral approaches, we advance AI-driven methods by integrating attention mechanisms into deep learning architectures. Using multispectral data from the EuroSAT dataset, our models achieve up to 86 percent classification accuracy, significantly outperforming standard networks. The attention-based framework enhances the modelâ€™s ability to focus on the most relevant spatial and spectral features, resulting in robust and generalizable performance.

Together, these advances form a comprehensive framework for reliable water monitoring systems, supporting water resource management, biodiversity conservation, and climate resilience.

So if you're into computer vision, you are likely dealing with some [deep-learning flavoured techniques]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-takes-over-again/). This means that you are possibly struggling to compile and run some code written in [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org). This post lists some of the problems I found in compiling MatCaffe on Mac.
I particular, I am using Matlab R2012b on a Macbook Pro running Mac OS X El Capitan.<br>
<br>
First, I followed the [official installation guide](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_osx.html) strictly: I installed [CUDA 7.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), and installed all dependencies (no Anaconda Python) using [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh):

{% highlight bash %}
brew install -vd snappy leveldb gflags glog szip lmdb
# need the homebrew science source for OpenCV and hdf5
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install hdf5 opencv
{% endhighlight %}

No problem here, so I moved to [compilation](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html#compilation). Let's start by ```make all -j8```.
Here I found the following problems:

#### 1 - Missing Protobuf
{% highlight bash  %}
$ make all
protoc --proto_path=src --cpp_out=build/src src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto
make: protoc: No such file or directory
make: *** [build/src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.cc] Error 1
{% endhighlight %}

Solution, install it.
{% highlight bash  %}
brew install protobuf
{% endhighlight %}

#### 2 - Missing BLAS library

{% highlight bash  %}
fatal error: 'cblas.h' file not found
#include <cblas.h>
1 error generated.
make: *** [build/src/caffe/blob.o] Error 1
{% endhighlight %}
Solution, install it:
{% highlight bash %}
brew install homebrew/science/openblas
{% endhighlight %}
And do the following changes in ```Makefile.config```:
{% highlight bash %}
BLAS := open
BLAS_INCLUDE := $(shell brew --prefix openblas)/include
BLAS_LIB := $(shell brew --prefix openblas)/lib
INCLUDE_DIRS += $(shell brew --prefix)/include
LIBRARY_DIRS += $(shell brew --prefix)/lib
{% endhighlight %}

With this I could build ```make all``` and ```make test```, but I found the following problem when running ```make runtest```:

#### 3 - CUDA not found
{% highlight bash %}
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libcudart.7.5.dylib
Reason: image not found 
make: *** [runtest] Trace/BPT trap: 5
{% endhighlight %}

Solution, set the environment variable:
{% highlight bash %}
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib/
{% endhighlight %}

So, next was to build MatCaffe ```make matcaffe```, for which I had to change:
{% highlight bash %}
MATLAB_DIR := /Applications/MATLAB_R2012b.app/
{% endhighlight %}

But when running a test from Matlab I encountered the following problem (even if I had set the correct ```DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH```).

#### 4 - CUDA not found from Matlab
{% highlight matlab %}
Invalid MEX-file 'matlab/+caffe/private/caffe_.mexmaci64':
dlopen(matlab/+caffe/private/caffe_.mexmaci64, 1): Library not loaded: @rpath/libcudart.7.5.dylib
  Referenced from: matlab/+caffe/private/caffe_.mexmaci64
  Reason: image not found
{% endhighlight %}

And the solution to this was in two fronts. First, Matlab was taking his own CUDA libraries, so I simply renamed them (not sure this affects Matlab in some way...):
{% highlight bash %}
mv /Applications/MATLAB_R2012b.app/bin/maci64/libcudart.dylib /Applications/MATLAB_R2012b.app/bin/maci64/libcudart.bkp
mv /Applications/MATLAB_R2012b.app/bin/maci64/libcublas.dylib /Applications/MATLAB_R2012b.app/bin/maci64/libcublas.bkp
{% endhighlight %}

And second, it seems that Mac OS X El Capitan implements some type of protection ([System Integrity Protection](https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide.pdf)) that clears ```DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH``` when executing Matlab.
To prevent this, I followed the comment in this [thread](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/2320):

1. Boot to Recovery OS by restarting your machine and holding down the ```Command``` + ```R``` keys at startup.
2. Launch ```Terminal``` from the ```Utilities``` menu.
3. Enter the following command: ```csrutil disable```
4. Restart

Please note that you need to run Matlab from a command line with the correct value for ```DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH``` by doing:
{% highlight bash %}
/Applications/MATLAB_R2012b.app/bin/matlab &
{% endhighlight %}
And with this it worked! Enjoy and comment if this helped you. :)

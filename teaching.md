During my doctoral program, I was a Teaching Assistant for the course EE2008: Data Structures and Algorithms. I have taught this course for <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home2012/SOUMYABR001/teach_AY2014.html">Sem 1 AY 2014-15</a>, for which I am the recipient of <a href="https://soumyabratadev.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/teaching_award_fall2014.pdf">Commendable Teaching Assistant award</a> from NTU Singapore. Additionally, I have taught this course for <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home2012/SOUMYABR001/teach_AY2015.html">Sem 2 AY 2015-16</a> session. Also, in Sem 1 AY 2016-17, I was involved in peer-tutoring sessions for this course.

I was also involved in teaching Junior College students, as a part of our university outreach programs. Check out the <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home2012/SOUMYABR001/ledcube.html">LED Cube workshop</a> page.

## Outreach
I am also involved in outreach activities and teaching Junior College students, as a part of the university outreach programs. I participate regularly in public engagement programmes conducted by ADAPT Centre, Dublin. I also worked on fun and interesting projects during my doctoral program at NTU. I taught students how to build antenna using regular tin cans (more popularly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantenna">cantenna</a>). Additionally, I explained arduino programming using a block of LEDs - check out our <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home2012/SOUMYABR001/ledcube.html">LED Cube workshop</a> page. 


I supervise students in their Master of Science (MSc) research thesis, and also mentor Final Year Projects (FYPs) and <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/TalentOutreach/NRP/Pages/index.aspx">Nanyang Research Program</a> (NRP) projects.

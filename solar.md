# Solar Analytics

## Objective 
To provide useful insights in the field of solar analytics using ground-based cameras and other weather sensors. 

## Team
Worked in collaboration with:
- [Nanyang Technological University Singapore](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/eyhlee/)
- [Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC)](http://vintage.winklerbros.net/index.html), Singapore
- [Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/copernicus-institute-of-sustainable-development), Utrecht University, The Netherlands. 

## Description 
In most cases of atmospheric study, collocated weather stations are present alongside ground-based sky cameras. Unlike solar pyranometers and other regular meteorological sensors, ground-based sky images have additional information about the continuous evolution of cloud over time. We use cloud/sky images to propose a solar radiation estimation model, that can accurately capture the short-term fluctuations of solar irradiance. We also use these sequence of images to estimate cloud motion fields, and thereby predict future locations of cloud with a lead time of a few minutes. These solar estimation and cloud forecasting techniques can be applied in the field of solar energy generation and forecasting.

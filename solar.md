# Solar Analytics

## Objective 
To provide useful insights in the field of solar analytics using ground-based cameras and other weather sensors. 

## Team
This is a collaborative work between:
- [Nanyang Technological University Singapore](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/eyhlee/)
- [Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC)](http://vintage.winklerbros.net/index.html), Singapore
- [Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/copernicus-institute-of-sustainable-development), Utrecht University, The Netherlands. 

## Description 
In most cases of atmospheric study, collocated weather stations are present alongside ground-based sky cameras. Unlike solar pyranometers and other regular meteorological sensors, ground-based sky images have additional information about the continuous evolution of cloud over time. In this research theme, we attempt to use a multi-modal approach of using data from various sensors to better understand solar energy estimation and forecasting. 

We use techniques derived from time-series theory, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05872">model the seasonality<> of solar irradiance, as captured in solar sensors. In addition to using weather data, we also derive solar analytics information from images, captured via ground-based sky cameras. We use these cloud/sky images to propose a solar radiation estimation model, that can accurately <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02546">capture the short-term fluctuations</a> of solar irradiance. We also use these sequence of images to estimate cloud motion fields, and thereby predict future locations of cloud with a lead time of a few minutes. These solar estimation and cloud forecasting techniques can be applied in the field of solar energy generation and forecasting.

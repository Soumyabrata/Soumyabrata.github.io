# Research 
My research interests include image processing, machine learning, and remote sensing. I solve problems in digital multimedia, cloud imaging, and solar and renewable energy. 

<br />
Our group is currently working on the following research themes. Please navigate into the individual research themes for more details. 


## [<u>Cloud Imaging</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/cloud/)
In this project, we develop low-cost, high resolution, ground-based sky cameras for imaging the atmosphere. These cameras capture continuous stream of images, which are essential to learn cloud dynamics and understand various atmospheric events. We devise state-of-the-art image segmentation and image classification algorithms that computes automated cloud coverage data, recognizes cloud types and estimates the cloud-base height.

## [<u>Solar Analytics</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/solar/)
In this project, we use a multi-modal data integration approach, in using various sensors (camera images + weather station recordings) to provide useful insights about solar energy. We use image- and weather-station- data for accurate solar energy estimation and forecasting. This is useful in the field of photovoltaic (PV) generation and integration.

## [<u>Multimedia</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/multimedia/)
This project involves designing an advertisement detection- and integration- system for multimedia videos. It is useful for next-generation online publicity (viz. product placement and embedded marketing), wherein advertisements are seamlessly integrated into the video scenes. We use deep-learning based techniques for determining if a video frame contains an existing advert, and for accurate localization of adverts in the selected video frame. Subsequently, new adverts are seamlessly implanted into the original video, to create a new augmented video. [[read more](https://soumyabrata.github.io/multimedia/)]

## [<u>Communications</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/communication/)
This project deals with the analysis of user- interaction and cooperation in wireless networks. We propose algorithmic framework, that helps in improving the performance of the IEEE 802.11 protocol. 

<br />
We also work in proposing a dynamic frequency allocation and interference mitigation algorithm for dense urban wireless networks. The algorithm is implemented and tested on-air in a proprietary Ericsson software.

## [<u>Software</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/software/)
In this research theme, we dealt with several software-related issues. Heap management is responsible for the allocation of heap segments to a running application. We propose a new heap management technique that has an inherent auto compaction technique in its algorithm leading to minimum fragmentation of memory space. 

<br />
We also developed randomized cryptographic techniques that can be effectively provide better security solutions.

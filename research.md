# Research 
My research interests lie primarily in statistical image processing, remote sensing, pattern recognition, and machine learning. I am currently working on using deep-learning techniques for effective image- and video- analysis in consumer videos.    



Following are a few of my research projects:

## Cloud Imaging
In this project, we develop low-cost, high resolution, ground-based sky cameras for imaging the sky scene. These cameras capture continuous stream of images, which are essential to learn cloud dynamics and understand various atmospheric events. We devise state-of-the-art image segmentation and image classification algorithms that computes automated cloud coverage data, recognizes cloud types and estimates the cloud-base height.

## Communications
This project deals with the analysis of user- interaction and cooperation in wireless networks. It helps in improving the performance of the IEEE 802.11 protocol. 

<br />
We also work in proposing a dynamic frequency allocation and interference mitigation algorithm for dense urban wireless networks. The algorithm is implemented and tested on-air in a proprietary Ericsson software.

## Software
Heap management is responsible for the allocation of heap segments to a running application. We propose a new heap management technique that has an inherent auto compaction technique in its algorithm leading to minimum fragmentation of memory space. 

<br />
We also developed randomized cryptographic techniques that can be effectively provide better security solutions.

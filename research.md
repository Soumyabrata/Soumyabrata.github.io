# Research 
My research interests include image processing, machine learning, and remote sensing. I solve problems in atmospheric science, multimedia, ehealth, and network security. 

<br />
Our group is currently working on the following research themes. Please navigate into the individual research themes for more details. 


## [<u>Cloud Imaging</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/cloud/)
In this project, we develop low-cost, high resolution, ground-based sky cameras for imaging the atmosphere. These cameras capture continuous stream of images, which are essential to learn cloud dynamics and understand various atmospheric events. We devise state-of-the-art image segmentation and image classification algorithms that computes automated cloud coverage data, recognizes cloud types and estimates the cloud-base height.

## [<u>Solar Analytics</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/solar/)
In this project, we use a multi-modal data integration approach, in using various sensors (camera images + weather station recordings) to provide useful insights about solar energy. We use image- and weather-station- data for accurate solar energy estimation and forecasting. This is useful in the field of photovoltaic (PV) generation and integration.

## [<u>Multimedia</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/multimedia/)
This project involves designing an advertisement detection- and integration- system for multimedia videos. It is useful for next-generation online publicity (viz. product placement and embedded marketing), wherein advertisements are seamlessly integrated into the video scenes. We use deep-learning based techniques for determining if a video frame contains an existing advert, and for accurate localization of adverts in the selected video frame. Subsequently, new adverts are seamlessly implanted into the original video, to create a new augmented video. [[read more](https://soumyabrata.github.io/multimedia/)]

## [<u>Security</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/security/)
Software Defined Networking (SDN) has transformed the manner in which we manage the network, without regard to the underlying network technology. It is now easier and cheaper to scale networking solutions to different devices. However, such networking systems are more prone to security vulnerabilities as compared to traditional systems. In this research theme, we explore machine learning technique to develop security solutions for such networks. [[read more](https://soumyabrata.github.io/security/)]


## [<u>E-Health</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/ehealth/)
Medicine has traditionally always been an empirical field. With the onset of higher computing power and availability of large-scale dataset, it is now increasingly easier to derive insights of any disease. In this research theme, we have set an ambitious goal to use machine-learning models to characterize the empirical model of medicine. [[read more](https://soumyabrata.github.io/ehealth/)]

## [<u>Communications</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/communication/)
This project deals with the analysis of user- interaction and cooperation in wireless networks. We propose algorithmic framework, that helps in improving the performance of the IEEE 802.11 protocol. 

<br />
We also work in proposing a dynamic frequency allocation and interference mitigation algorithm for dense urban wireless networks. The algorithm is implemented and tested on-air in a proprietary Ericsson software.

## [<u>Software</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/software/)
In this research theme, we dealt with several software-related issues. Heap management is responsible for the allocation of heap segments to a running application. We propose a new heap management technique that has an inherent auto compaction technique in its algorithm leading to minimum fragmentation of memory space. 

<br />
We also developed randomized cryptographic techniques that can be effectively provide better security solutions.

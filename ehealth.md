# E-Health

## Objective 
To derive important insights from biomedical data using machine learning models. 

## Team
This is a collaborative work between:
- [ADAPT SFI Research Centre](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/)
- [University College Dublin](https://www.cs.ucd.ie/)

## Description 
The field of medicine has witnessed great improvement because of technological advancements. It has become easier to collect a range of healthcare data due to low-cost wearable devices. The insights acquired from mining clinical data have proved useful for decision making in improving healthcare and reducing healthcare costs.

<br />
In this research theme, we perform proactive medical diagnostics using statistical and machine-learning techniques. Using a publicly available dataset of electronic health records, we identify the key risk factors associated with stroke.
